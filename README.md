# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Neural Network ,SVM , Logistic Regression etc. 


Here we examine a csv dataset containing 14 health parameters of 303 persons . Based on those records we implement the above mentioned ML algorithms and split the data set into testing and training and predict whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.


For implementing the various algorithms we first have to split the dataset int training data and testing data . In our study we have split the data in the form ‘training:testing” as “0.8:0.2”. We have carried out all these implementation in Google Colaboratory . All the programming was done in Python programming language .We set the run time time to GPU because the memory requirements for implementation of the above mentioned algorithms are comparatively more and using GPU runtime we can process the data in quick manner .

The methodology of performing classification here involves performing first the EDA on our dataset and then splitting our data into training and testing dataset .Once we gain the required knowledge , we make models respective to the ML Algorithmsthat we used .Once the implementation part is done , we output the accuracy obtained from each of these algorithms and them compare all of them . 

After succesful implementation of all the ML models we can conclude that Decision Tree provides us the maximum accuracy .
